# Audio-Visualiser-Esp
An Esp8266 project for visualising [cava](https://github.com/karlstav/cava) output on an oled display.

Similar to https://github.com/Nannk/Audio-Visualiser, but uses cava ascii output. Faster hardware is required (esp8266 works fine with 32bars at 20fps, higher fps results in dropped data).
